# Quality Checklist

Treat the report as acceptable only if all items below pass.

## Structural checks

- The report lives in its own folder.
- The folder contains `report.md`.
- The folder contains `images/`.
- The final handoff may omit transient helper files such as `wechat_paste.md` or `source_text.txt`.
- The report includes a header snapshot and `关键词`.
- The report does not expose a local filesystem PDF path; it prefers a DOI or official paper URL when available.
- The report does not include a separate `论文标题` line or an `输出时间` line.
- The top `#` title reads like a standard academic Chinese translation of the paper title, not a slogan-style summary.
- Section `1` explains the problem, the idea origin, and the innovation points.
- Section `2` contains technical-core screenshots and explanations.
- Section `3` contains experiment or simulation evidence screenshots and explanations, and its title matches the paper's evidence type rather than defaulting to a setup-heavy label.
- Section `4` contains exactly three numbered audience-specific items.
- Section `5` provides a final summary.

## Screenshot checks

- At least one section-2 technical-core image is present.
- At least one section-3 evidence image is present.
- The report places one title-author header image directly below the top `#` title.
- Each image referenced from `report.md` uses a hosted URL or an explicit `__PUBLIC_IMAGE_PREFIX__` placeholder rather than a local path.
- Each screenshot is readable without zooming aggressively.
- When the paper contains multiple complementary comparison figures or a comparison figure plus a summary table, section `3` includes more than one evidence screenshot.
- Every referenced theorem, lemma, assumption, property, proposition, remark, or algorithm screenshot contains the full target block and does not spill into `Proof`, the next block, or unrelated body text.
- Every referenced figure or table screenshot contains the full panel plus caption and does not leak into the next figure, next table, or unrelated paragraph text.
- When multiple candidate crops were generated for the same evidence block, the cleanest acceptable crop is the one referenced from `report.md`.

## Content checks

- Innovation points are separated from generic background.
- The `##` headings read like a formal academic report rather than question prompts.
- The section-3 heading uses professional academic wording such as `仿真结果与对比分析`, `实验结果与对比分析`, or `仿真与实验验证` when those labels fit the paper better than `实验设计`.
- Markdown emphasis is present but restrained; bold and italics help reading rather than creating visual noise.
- Common keywords are translated into natural Chinese when standard translations exist.
- The section-2 explanation says what the block defines, assumes, guarantees, or changes in the method.
- For control-oriented papers, the report writes out the core system-model equations in LaTeX rather than leaving the model only in screenshots or prose.
- For control-oriented papers, the system-model formulas are accompanied by short symbol-level explanation of state, input, output, disturbance, gain, or error terms.
- If the paper uses supporting `Theorem`, `Lemma`, `Assumption`, `Property`, `Proposition`, or `Remark` blocks to support a theorem or method step, the report explains that dependency chain and the role of the citation.
- If a later theorem explicitly relies on an earlier theorem, the earlier theorem is not skipped merely because the later one looks more advanced.
- If the report explicitly discusses a `Lemma`, `Assumption`, `Property`, or `Remark`, section `2` includes the corresponding screenshot rather than only a downstream theorem screenshot.
- The section-3 explanation says what is measured, what baseline or comparison object is used, and what conclusion is justified.
- Section `4` follows the fixed audience order: `入门者`, `硕博学生`, `教授`.
- The beginner item says what a newcomer should learn from the paper first and gives one concrete entry direction.
- The graduate-student item gives one plausible extension or research direction rather than repeating the original contribution.
- The professor item gives one practical suggestion on how to guide students, scope the problem, or organize the work.
- Each section-4 item includes a mathematical derivation difficulty label.
- In section `4`, each item is concise: `对象 + 标题 + 斜体核心建议 + 数学推导难度`, with no separate `说明` field in the default format.
- The final `report.md` also uses hosted image URLs or an explicit `__PUBLIC_IMAGE_PREFIX__` placeholder rather than local `images/...` paths.
- Longer formulas are broken onto separate lines with `$$...$$` rather than being forced into narrow inline layout.

## Repair strategy

If the report fails:

1. Fix structure first.
2. Fix screenshot coverage second.
3. Tighten the explanations and section-4 audience-specific advice last.

## Final self-review

- Re-run the checklist after the final public image URLs are written into `report.md`, not only before URL rewriting.
- Confirm the final output folder keeps `report.md` and `images/`, while transient helper artifacts such as `source_text.txt`, `report.rendered.md`, and temporary page-cache folders are removed unless the user asked to keep them.
- Summarize the self-review result in the final user-facing response, including whether `validate_report.py` passed and whether the referenced screenshots meet the standard.
